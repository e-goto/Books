Completed:
1. Code Complete (McConnell)

Summary: Reduce complexity

2. Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)

Thoughts: A lot of the math went over my head so most of it was quickly skimmed. Was good for picking out key topics that I should research later. Didn't read Part 2 as I feel its better to reference it when needed.

3. Build APIs You won't Hate (Phil Sturgeon)

Thoughts: Basic overview of APIs, maybe not enough depth for a thorough understanding. Also is not language agnostic and uses code examples with PHP and specific libraries, some which are the authors own. Will supplement with a different book.

4. RESTFul Web Services Cookbook (Allamaraju)

Thoughts: Reading this made me think that Build APIs You won't hate was quite useful from a practical perspective. I think I would have been fine with just reading the other one

5. Understanding Distributed Systems (Vitillo)

Thoughts: Great starting point for distributed systems. Provides an easy to digest introduction to many distributed systems concepts and provides links to many interesting articles for further reading.

6. Web Application Security, A Beginner's Guide (Sullivan, Liu)

Since my web security knowledge was at a pretty basic level this was a good read. Learned things I didn't know very well like SQL injections, cross site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), directory traversal. Some of the examples were really old which I thought was weird (myspace, silverlight, flash, facebook).

7. A Philosophy of Software Design (Ousterhout)

Thoughts: Reduce complexity

8. Database Design for Mere Mortals: 25th Anniversary Edition (Hernandez)

Reinforced? the basic termniology of databases. Would be nicer if there was more application? Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to the examples in the book. Large portions of the book weren't super applicable because they taught you about interviewing people to make databases

9. NoSQL Distilled (Sandalage, Fowler)

Introductory book to NoSQL. Learned about map reduce, column databases, graph databases.
