In Progress
- Build APIs You won't Hate (Phil Sturgeon)

Thinking of Reading (In order of priority):
- Web Scalability for Startup Engineers (Ejsmont)
- Architecture Patterns with Python (Pericval, Gregory)
- Phoenix Project
- Mythical Man Month
- Pragmatic Programmer (Thomas, Hunt)
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppman)
- Refactoring (Fowler)
- Domain Driven Design (Eric Evans)

Completed:
1. Code Complete (McConnell)
Summary: Reduce complexity

2. Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)
Thoughts: A lot of the math went over my head so most of it was quickly skimmed. Was good for picking out key topics that I should research later. Didn't read Part 2 as I feel its better to reference it when needed.
