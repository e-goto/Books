In Progress
- Understanding Distributed Systems (Vitillo)


Thinking of Reading (In order of priority):
- Web Scalability for Startup Engineers (Ejsmont)
- Architecture Patterns with Python (Pericval, Gregory)
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Kleppman)
- Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems (Newman)
- SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming (Karwin)
- Database Design for Mere Mortals: 25th Anniversary Edition (Hernandez)
- Phoenix Project
- Mythical Man Month
- Pragmatic Programmer (Thomas, Hunt)
- Refactoring (Fowler)
- Domain Driven Design (Eric Evans)

Completed:
1. Code Complete (McConnell)

Summary: Reduce complexity

2. Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena)

Thoughts: A lot of the math went over my head so most of it was quickly skimmed. Was good for picking out key topics that I should research later. Didn't read Part 2 as I feel its better to reference it when needed.

3. Build APIs You won't Hate (Phil Sturgeon)

Thoughts: Basic overview of APIs, maybe not enough depth for a thorough understanding. Also is not language agnostic and uses code examples with PHP and specific libraries, some which are the authors own. Will supplement with a different book.

4. RESTFul Web Services Cookbook (Allamaraju)

Thoughts: Reading this made me think that Build APIs You won't hate was quite useful from a practical perspective. I think I would have been fine with just reading the other one
