List of technical articles I've read and found useful are listed here.

1. [Timeouts, retries and backoff with jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/)
- build resilient systems by employing timeouts and retrying with backoff + jitter
2. [Exponential backoff and jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/)
- shows how jitter reduces workload
3. [Two random choices](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2012/01/17/two-random.html)
